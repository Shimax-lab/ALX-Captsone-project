This  app is called News Hobby
It is built using react 
For routing I used react router dom
it fetchs news from multiple sources and display in one location at NewsHobby homepage
You then choose to which article to read, when you click on it takes you to the article details page, however because I am using a free plan for the API it doesn't load the whole article rather you click on it and it takes you to the source
The api i am using is from https://newsapi.org/
When news are fetched they are stored in the local storage and then you can access any article displayed you want
the searchbar allows you to navigate through the heft news which are created on a daily basis and it cames you to the searh results page
